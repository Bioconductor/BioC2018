## Call for posters and short contributed talks

_BioC 2018_ invites abstracts on research to be presented as a poster
or short oral presentations (10 minutes including questions) to the
full conference. Please submit an abstract of up to 300 words, which
will be peer-reviewed by the conference committee for selection in the
conference programme. Include links to software where relevant. In the

you are interested in giving a talk, poster, or both.

## Call for workshops

_BioC 2018_ invites submissions of contributed workshops in short
(50-minute) and long (1h 45m) formats for parallel afternoon workshop
sessions. Short workshops may teach a single package or technique;
long workshops should teach more complex workflows involving a range
of methods.  Please use the [Workshop Submission Form][] and
[Workshop Template][]. Workshop proposals will be peer-reviewed by the
conference committee for selection in the programme.

## Call for scholarship applications

A limited number of travel, lodging, and/or registration scholarships
are available for students.  Scholarship requests and eligibility
conditions are described on the conference registration form.

## Birds of a Feather / Special Interest Groups

We invite participants to form groups dedicated to discuss or work on
topics of interest. We will make rooms available for groups to meet
during the lunch breaks. We encourage students, postdocs and junior
faculty to participant and form groups.

To create a special interest group [open an issue][] describing the
topic. The issue title should start with SIG: followed by a short but
descriptive title. In the issue, include:

- An introduction of yourself.
- A description of the topic.
- Whether it should be held during Developer Day (Wednesday July 25)
  or the conference days (July 26-27).
- Desired outputs (could be code, a piece of documentation, or general
  discussion), and possible outcomes.

Interested participants should use the issue to ask questions and/or
express their interest in participating. Proposals with interest shown
by at least 3 additional participants by July 12 will be announced on
the conference web page, and will have a room reserved for their
meeting.
