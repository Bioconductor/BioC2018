# Call for posters and short contributed talks

Bioc2018 invites abstracts on research to be presented as a poster and/or short oral presentations (10 minutes including questions) to the full conference. Please submit an abstract of up to 300 words, which will be peer-reviewed by the conference committee for selection in the conference programme. Include links to software where relevant. In the submission form, you will be able to specify whether you are interested in giving a talk, poster, or both. [Poster/talk submission form](https://goo.gl/forms/meoGgX7eipL2ZHKD2).

# Call for workshops

Bioc2018 invites submissions of contributed workshops in short (50-minute) and long (1h 45m) formats for parallel afternoon workshop sessions. Short workshops may teach a single package or technique; long workshops should teach more complex workflows involving a range of methods.  Please submit a syllabus using the provided [Markdown template](https://github.com/Bioconductor/BioC2018/blob/master/resources/workshop-syllabus.md), which will be peer-reviewed by the conference committee for selection in the programme.

# Call for scholarship applications

A limited number of travel, lodging, and/or registration scholarships are available for students.  Scholarship requests and eligibility conditions are described on the conference registration form. 

# Birds of a Feather/Special Interest Groups

We invite participants to form groups dedicated to discuss or work on topics of interest. We will make rooms available for groups to meet during the lunch breaks. We encourage students, postdocs and junior faculty to participant and form groups.
To create a special interest group [open an issue](https://github.com/Bioconductor/BioC2018/issues) describing the topic. The issue title should start with SIG: followed by a short but descriptive title. In the issue, include:
* an introduction of yourself
* a description of the topic
* whether it should be held during Developer Day (Wednesday July 25) or the conference days (July 26-27)
* desired outputs (could be code, a piece of documentation, or general discussion), and possible outcomes.
Interested participants should use the issue to ask questions and/or express their interest in participating. Proposals with interest shown by at least 3 additional participants by July 12 will be announced on the conference web page, and will have a room reserved for their meeting.
